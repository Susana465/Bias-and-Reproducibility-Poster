# Bias-and-Reproducibility-Poster
## Bias and reproducibility in a computational neurobiology PhD's journey. This was a poster created for the COMBINE and ICSB 2022 conferences.

### What do I do?
-	Computer modelling
-	Look at synaptic molecules
-	Try to understand learning and memory
- Make this research as ethical and accessible as I go along

### Where am I coming from? 
I wanted to look at biases in the research that I do and this brought me to the realization that in order to remove them and/or make them more clear I had to make my research also more reproducible and accessible. The original bias is that we think “there is no bias in my research”. 

My PhD and any research endeavour is a journey. A journey which can generally be divided into different milestones. And in each step of the way we can carry some type of biased information as well as tools to overcome them or at least point them out. At the same time, in order to make my PhD research more ethical, reproducibility and accessibility are key.

So, I divided some of the questions I have been asking myself into different sections of the research journey.

I briefly describe each section, then offer references and resources to look at bias and how to make research more reproducible at each stage of a research journey; I have sorted them out through the 4 different steps:

1. Design
2. Data Collection
3. Data Analysis
4. Reporting.

## Design

###  What's the Bias here?:
This part of the project is key to lay out initial biases and prevent further bias feedback. We can ask questions like: 

- Who is my data including/excluding? 
- What am I assuming?
- How much am I simplifying?

I look at data that comes from non-human animals. We generally make assumptions that because we did an experiment on a mouse, this is likely to be similar in humans. But we ought to recognise these are just assumptions. 
Other assumptions in my research can be the fact that I explain memory and learning in very simplified, reduced ways, usually using specific molecules to describe a process that is extremely complex and that we don’t fully understand all the caveats of. 

### Tools for reproducibility:
Planning for reproducibility from the beginning is key.
Version control, code literacy and planning where I will keep and share my data from the beginning have been a livesaviour. See below some good places to get you started, I have learnt lots from these sites:

-  [Guide for Project Design](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/project-design/project-design.html?highlight=design)
-  [(re)Learn how to Version Control on Git](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/git-novice-branch-pr/)
-  [The Good Research Code Handbook](https://goodresearch.dev/)
-  [Defining Reproducibility/Replicability/Robustness/Generalisability](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/overview/overview-definitions.html)

I started my PhD in order to better understand how memory works inside the brain cells (neurons) in our brains. In order to do so, I create computer models of molecular interactions that can help predict how molecules are working inside neurons. 

As time went by I started to become more and more aware that in order to create meaningful work, I should make the work I create truly accessible and reproducible. This way, the projects I work on could be easily reproduced and understood both by my academic peers but also by people who might not be familiar with my research.

#### Current Projects

- PhD: Creating Computer models of CaMKII/NMDAR dynamics in 3D using [MCell](https://mcell.org/), [BioNetGen](http://bionetgen.org/) and [Biodynamo](https://biodynamo.org/)

- [Alan Turing Enrichment Student](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/enrichment-students/susana-roman-garcia)

- [Open Life Sciences (cohort 6)](https://openlifesci.org/): 
  During my time at OLS I hope to work on creating a framework within my PhD that allows the questioning of ethical standards and reproducibility of computer models in Computational Neurobiology.
